      <h1>Carlos Salcido's First HTML Project</h>
        <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
        <p1> HTML the basics to the internet.
          HTML stands for hpyer text markup language, the pages are linked
          throught hyper links. They are links that we click on that takes
          us from page to page. There are several different types of files
          that are accesable on the internet. Those files are Plain Text, HTML,
          Images,Videos, and Music. All of the files are accesable because of
          HTTP, that stand for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
          <h2>HTML basics</h2>
          <p2>HTML is what you see on the internet page, it gives you refences
            to videos, documents, imagaes and so many more things.
            <br>
            <h3>The Bold Tag</h3>
            The very first TAG I learned about is the Bold Tag.
            <br>
            <br><b> The Bold Tag causes all the text within it to be bold</b>
            <br>
            <br><h3> The Italic Tag</h3>
            The second tag that I learned about is the Italics Tag,
            the italic tag is a sloping letter you can use to emphasize words.
            <br>
            <br><em> This is an emample of what the italic tag looks like.</em>
          <br>
          <h3>End Tags</h3>
           When you are using tags it is important to close the tag.
            if you dont close the tag (ie <b>everything that you write after the
            bold opening tag will be bold)</b> or another example is <em>
              if I don't close the em tag everything reamins italicized,</em>
              <br>
              <br><h3>Making Hyper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Links</a></h3>
              The third tag I learned about is the Anchor tag, with this tag
              I can make links that direct me to another web page.
              <br><h3> Adding <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=v89eWuvvOYKGtQX4urGIBg&q=image+definition&oq=image+de&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0l10.1712.2109.0.3914.3.3.0.0.0.0.102.298.1j2.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.3.297...0i131i67k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i10k1.0.xk9hYloYI_Y">Images</a></h3>
              You can add images as a link to to any page and it will alos appear
              as a hyper link just like this picutre of the Greatest-Haircut-Ever<img src=http://www.maniacworld.com/greatest-haircut-ever.jpg alt=Greatest-Haircut-Ever>
              <br> <h3> Additional Tags</h3>
              I learned about many other tage, like the break and div tag,
              but if I need to reference anything I have access to several resource.
              like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">w3schools HTML Element Reference</a>
